            <h1>SUN</h1>
            <p>The Sun is the star at the center of our Solar System and the single most dominant astronomical body, accounting for over 99.8% of the system's entire mass. Classified as a G2 V star, or a typical yellow dwarf on the main sequence, it is a massive, nearly perfect sphere of superheated, electrically charged gas called plasma. This star is approximately 4.6 billion years old and is currently in the middle of its stable life cycle.</p>
            
            <h3>Structure and Power Generation</h3>
            <p>The Sun is not solid but is composed primarily of hydrogen (about 73% of its mass) and helium (about 25%), with trace amounts of heavier elements. Its structure is divided into several layers:</p>
            
            <p><b>Core:</b> This is the Sun's engine room, where temperatures reach a staggering 15 million degrees Celsius (27 million degrees Fahrenheit). At this immense heat and pressure, nuclear fusion occurs, converting hydrogen atoms into helium atoms. Every second, the core fuses approximately 600 billion kilograms of hydrogen, converting about 4 million kilograms of mass directly into energy, which is released as high-energy photons (gamma rays).</p>
            
            <p><b>Radiative Zone & Convective Zone:</b> Energy travels outward from the core through the radiative zone and then churns through the convective zone before reaching the visible surface.</p>
            
            <p><b>Photosphere:</b> This is the visible "surface" layer, which is about 5,500°C (10,000°F). It is here that sunspots—cooler, darker regions caused by intense magnetic field activity—are observed.</p>
            
            <p><b>Chromosphere and Corona:</b> These are the thin atmospheric layers above the photosphere. Surprisingly, the outermost layer, the corona, is extremely hot, reaching temperatures of up to 2 million degrees Celsius, a phenomenon that remains one of the Sun's great mysteries.</p>
            
            <h3>Influence and Activity</h3>
            <p>The Sun's immense gravity is what holds the entire Solar System together, keeping the eight planets, dwarf planets, asteroids, and comets locked in their orbits. The energy produced in its core travels as light and heat, taking approximately 8 minutes and 20 seconds to reach Earth, providing the essential light and warmth necessary for all life on our planet.</p>
            
            <p>The Sun is a dynamic star, constantly undergoing solar activity. This includes:</p>
            
            <p><b>Solar Wind:</b> A continuous stream of charged particles and plasma escaping the Sun's corona and flowing throughout the Solar System.</p>
            
            <p><b>Solar Flares and Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs):</b> Giant explosions of energy and plasma that can send vast amounts of charged particles toward Earth. While Earth's magnetic field and atmosphere largely protect us, these events can cause stunning auroras (Northern and Southern Lights) and, on rare occasions, disrupt satellite communications, radio signals, and power grids.</p>
            
            <h3>Future Evolution</h3>
            <p>The Sun has been shining stably for billions of years, but it has a finite lifespan. In approximately 5 billion years, it will run out of the hydrogen fuel in its core. At that point, the core will contract and heat up, causing the outer layers to dramatically expand. The Sun will transform into a red giant, growing so large that it will likely engulf Mercury, Venus, and possibly Earth. Following this phase, it will shed its outer layers, leaving behind a small, dense, and slowly cooling ember known as a white dwarf.</p>
