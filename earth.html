    <h1>EARTH</h1>
    <p>Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only known astronomical object to support life. It is a dynamic, water-rich world with diverse environments — from vast oceans and towering mountains to deserts and polar ice caps. Often called the “Blue Planet,” about 71% of Earth’s surface is covered by water, and its atmosphere provides the right conditions for sustaining millions of life forms.</p>
    
    <h3>Structure and Composition</h3>
    <p>Earth is a terrestrial planet, meaning it has a solid rocky surface and a layered internal structure. It consists of several key layers:</p>
    
    <p><b>Crust:</b> The outermost layer, composed of solid rock, forms continents and ocean floors. It is divided into large tectonic plates that move slowly over the planet’s surface.</p>
    
    <p><b>Mantle:</b> Beneath the crust lies the mantle, made of semi-solid rock that slowly flows due to convection currents, driving plate tectonics and volcanic activity.</p>
    
    <p><b>Outer Core and Inner Core:</b> The outer core is a layer of molten iron and nickel, while the inner core is solid and composed mainly of the same metals. The movement of the liquid outer core generates Earth’s magnetic field, protecting life from harmful solar radiation.</p>
    
    <h3>Atmosphere and Life</h3>
    <p>Earth’s atmosphere is a mixture of nitrogen (78%), oxygen (21%), and trace gases such as carbon dioxide, argon, and water vapor. This delicate balance allows life to thrive. The ozone layer within the atmosphere protects the surface from the Sun’s harmful ultraviolet radiation, while the greenhouse effect keeps the planet’s temperature stable.</p>
    
    <p>Earth’s biosphere includes all ecosystems — from the deepest ocean trenches to the highest mountain peaks. The planet’s unique combination of liquid water, suitable temperature, and atmosphere has allowed the evolution of complex life over billions of years.</p>
    
    <h3>Motion and Seasons</h3>
    <p>Earth rotates on its axis once every 24 hours, creating day and night. It also orbits the Sun once every 365.25 days, defining a year. The planet’s axial tilt of 23.5° causes seasonal changes as different regions receive varying amounts of sunlight throughout the year.</p>
    
    <h3>Natural Phenomena and Protection</h3>
    <p>Earth’s magnetic field, generated by its core, acts as a shield against solar winds and cosmic radiation. Its tectonic activity shapes continents, forms mountains, and triggers natural events like earthquakes and volcanic eruptions that recycle essential minerals and gases.</p>
    
    <h3>Future and Sustainability</h3>
    <p>Earth has existed for about 4.54 billion years and will remain habitable for billions more, provided the balance of its systems is maintained. However, human activity — including pollution, deforestation, and greenhouse gas emissions — poses a major threat to the planet’s stability. Efforts toward sustainability and climate protection are essential to preserving Earth as a home for future generations.</p>
