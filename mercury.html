            <h1>MERCURY</h1>
            <p>Mercury is the innermost planet, orbiting closest to the Sun. It's a world of extremes, characterized by its heavily cratered surface and incredible speed.</p>
            
            <h3>Surface and Landscape</h3>
            <p>Mercury's surface is often compared to that of Earth's Moon, as it is heavily pockmarked with impact craters. This is because Mercury has virtually no atmosphere to burn up incoming meteoroids.</p>
            
            <p><b>Craters:</b> The largest known feature is the Caloris Basin, a massive impact structure about 1,550 km (960 miles) in diameter, likely formed by a huge asteroid impact early in the planet's history.</p>
            
            <p><b>Scarps (Cliffs):</b>A unique feature of Mercury is the presence of long, steep cliffs called scarps. Scientists believe these formed as the planet's core cooled and shrank, causing the entire crust to wrinkle and buckle.</p>
            
            <p><b>Polar Ice:</b> Despite being so close to the Sun, radar observations have revealed deposits of water ice trapped permanently within the shadows of craters near Mercury's poles, where temperatures remain frigid.</p>
            
            <h3>Extreme Temperature Swings</h3>

            <p>Mercury experiences the most dramatic temperature range of any planet in the Solar System.</p>

            <p><b>Hot Side:</b> During the day, the temperature can soar up to 9$427^\circ\text{C}$ because it's so close to the Sun.10</p>
            
            <p><b>Cold Side:</b> However, because Mercury has almost no atmosphere to trap heat (unlike Earth or Venus), the night side quickly loses all its solar energy, dropping to frigid temperatures of around 11$-173^\circ\text{C}$.</p>
            
            <h3>Orbit and Rotation</h3>

            <p><b>astest Orbit:</b>Mercury zips around the Sun so quickly that its year lasts only about 88 Earth days.</p>

            <p><b>Slow Rotation:</b>Slow Rotation:</p>

            <p><b>3:2 Spin-Orbit Resonance:</b>For every two times Mercury orbits the Sun (two years), it rotates exactly three times. This results in a solar day (sunrise to next sunrise) on Mercury that lasts about 176 Earth days—longer than its own year!</p>

            <h3>Composition and Magnetic Field</h3>
            
            <p>Mercury is the second densest planet (after Earth). It is believed to have a massive iron core that makes up roughly 60% of its total mass.</p>

            <p><b>Core:</b>This large, molten metallic core generates a global magnetic field, a surprising discovery given the planet's relatively small size and slow rotation. This magnetic field is weak compared to Earth's, but it's strong enough to deflect the solar wind.</p>

            <p>Mercury's proximity to the Sun and its extreme environment make it one of the most challenging worlds to study, requiring specialized missions like Mariner 10 and the dedicated MESSENGER spacecraft, which orbited the planet from 2011 to 2015.</p>
