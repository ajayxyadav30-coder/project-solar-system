    <h1>JUPITER</h1>
    <p>Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and by far the largest in our Solar System. It is a gas giant, more massive than all the other planets combined, and is known for its swirling clouds, colorful bands, and the iconic Great Red Spot — a gigantic storm that has raged for centuries. Jupiter’s immense gravity and magnetic field make it one of the most fascinating celestial bodies to study.</p>
    
    <h3>Structure and Composition</h3>
    <p>Unlike Earth, Jupiter does not have a solid surface. It is composed primarily of hydrogen (about 90%) and helium (about 10%), with traces of water, ammonia, methane, and other compounds. Its internal structure is divided into several key layers:</p>
    
    <p><b>Atmosphere:</b> Jupiter’s outer layers are made of dense clouds of ammonia crystals and water vapor, forming the planet’s famous light and dark bands. High winds, reaching speeds of over 600 km/h, drive these ever-changing patterns.</p>
    
    <p><b>Liquid Hydrogen Layer:</b> Beneath the atmosphere, hydrogen exists in a liquid state due to immense pressure. This layer transitions into metallic hydrogen deeper down, where the pressure is so great that hydrogen atoms are squeezed into a metallic form, allowing them to conduct electricity.</p>
    
    <p><b>Core:</b> Jupiter likely has a small, dense core made of rock, metal, and hydrogen compounds. Scientists estimate the core’s mass to be about 10–20 times that of Earth.</p>
    
    <h3>Atmosphere and Weather</h3>
    <p>Jupiter’s atmosphere is a dynamic system of storms and jet streams. The most famous feature is the <b>Great Red Spot</b>, a massive, persistent storm larger than Earth itself. The planet also exhibits lightning flashes and auroras much stronger than those on Earth, caused by its powerful magnetic field interacting with solar wind and volcanic gases from its moon Io.</p>
    
    <h3>Moons and Rings</h3>
    <p>Jupiter has at least <b>95 known moons</b>, the largest being the four Galilean moons — Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto — discovered by Galileo Galilei in 1610. Ganymede, the largest moon in the Solar System, is even bigger than Mercury. Jupiter also has faint rings made of dust particles, though they are not as prominent as Saturn’s.</p>
    
    <h3>Magnetic Field and Radiation</h3>
    <p>Jupiter possesses the strongest magnetic field of any planet in the Solar System, extending millions of kilometers into space. This field traps charged particles, creating intense radiation belts that can damage spacecraft electronics. It also produces powerful auroras near the planet’s poles.</p>
    
    <h3>Exploration and Future Studies</h3>
    <p>Jupiter has been explored by several spacecraft, including Pioneer, Voyager, Galileo, Juno, and upcoming missions like JUICE (Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer). These missions aim to study its atmosphere, magnetosphere, and moons, some of which may harbor subsurface oceans and potential conditions for life.</p>
